        1. Below are the possible server responses:
            "QUIT ACK" --> server acknowledges the quit command that was sent. Prep client to quit as well.
            "PUT ACK" --> server acknowledges the put command it was sent. Prep client to send file.
            "GET ACK" --> server acknowledges the get command it was sent. Prep client to receive file.
            -------------------- CLIENT SIDE ERRORS (handled in separate function) ---------------------
            "TOO MANY ARGS" --> client sent too many args to the server.
            "UNRECOG COMM"  --> client sent an unrecognizable command to server.
            "NONEXIST FILE" --> client has requested from the server a non-existent file in the latter's database.
            "NO FILE" --> client had sent a put/get request, but without specifying a file name.
            "QUIT INVALID" --> client had sent the server arguments with the quit command. Server refused.
