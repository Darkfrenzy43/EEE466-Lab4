    Notes:

        1. We're going to have to save the client address each time we receive data from them. Like, for each command.

        2. Note on slice_and_send_udp() function:

            2.1: We want to ignore any duplicate ACKS we get from the receiving device,
            so, we'll create an ack history (probably a list) to contain the most recent
            ack from the receiver, and if we get a duplicate ack, we can recognize it if it is
            in the ack history and ignore it accordingly. As soon as we get a different ack
            the ack to the next message sent), then we can replace the recent ack history with
            what we just received, since we can anticipate any duplicate acks to be of that kind

            2.2: Okay, we're going to take a streamlined approach to sending the messages over,
            including the slice number to send - this is to ensure we ignore any duplicated acks for all sent msgs.

        3. Note on slice_and_send_udp() and recv_and_parse_udp():

            3.1: So contrary to the TCP version, I decided to use while loops for the sending and receiving of packets.
            Reason being is that the "counter" of the while loop will have the same value for given iterations
            depending on the unreliability of the network. To be more specific, say if the sender function is currently
            sending slice 3, and the receiving function does not receive the slice of data so no acknowledgement is
            sent back, then the sender function must re-iterate the same loop with the same counter value to
            send slice 3 again. This same principle applies for any duplicate or dropped packets in any order
            part of the transmission of data.

        4. Note on recv_and_parse_udp():

            4.1: So we're going to have to turn off timeouts when this function is waiting to receive a
            slice number. That's because this blocking receive would be the server's resting state when
            the user tries to figure out what command to send to the server. If we didn't turn off the
            timeouts (or disable them) then it would be impossible for the server to be used.


        5. Socket flushing:

            5.1: Huh, so I've encountered errors where invoking send file and send command functions back
            to back resulted in some strange behaviour where the sockets were reading data that were from
            previous UDP transactions. Of course with the way the code was written that would get into
            some issues as it would read an ACK as some data that was sent in a previous transaction.
            Thus, I figured after every use of a socket (either sending or receiving) we'll just have
            good practice of ensuring it is all emptied out before the next time it's used.

            5.2: Guess what! We're also doing it before any socket use, just to be sure. Wouldn't hurt to do so.
            Also because for some reason the flushing out still didn't flush everrrrything out - some data
            may still have been in transmission and hadn't arrived before the next time the server waits for input,
            basically meaning stuff will break.


        6. Last ACK not sent to sender:

            6.1: I'm encountering an annoying problem where there are often times when the last acknowledgement
            to send to the sender device gets dropped. The thing is, it's not an entire issue because at some point
            the client and the server will return to normal operations again after timeouts, but it's still
            an annoying situation. Honestly, I can't think of any solutions to it - in the end what had needed
            to be sent was sent in terms of data over the wire.

        7. Making the message history list and dictionary a class wide attribute:

            7.1: Yeah so I was also encountering another problem with UDP, where if the final message a sender or
            receiver sends to the other in a conversation, if it a duplicate, then 99% of the time the duplicates
            of the message end up getting passed as input in whatever next data transaction takes place, and
            consequently it screws everything up. that's when I realized I can't have these message histories span
            between messages within the scope of a given conversation, but also between the first and last messages
            of separate transactions. Hope this works.


    Status:

        - todo handle timeout cases now - I've got an idea.
        - We can test a certain timeout by setting the timeout retries for it to like 3,
        and have the rest of the timeouts to be 10. That way it's easier to simulate a time out
        at a certain part of the UDP transactions.
